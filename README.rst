Tincan - WebRTC based file sharing
==================================

This was an experiment in doing file sharing over WebRTC data channels. The
backend signaling server is written using Tornado (Python) and the front
end client using Backbone/Underscore/jQuery along with the DataChannel.js
from https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment.

No additional development is planned but you are welcome to explore and
